Noah Morton Project 3
Operating Systems - Cheng Mon/Wed 1pm

## Building:

Run `make` inside the project folder, this will compile it and produce
a binary called `project3`, which can be run. If `make` isn't
available, a typical `g++` invoke on the cpp files should work.

## Running:

I elected to go with the following syntax:

`./project3 input.txt`
