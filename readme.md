This repository should remain private. It's a collection of horrible
code I've written for one of the hardest and worst designed classes
I've ever taken.

I will keep it on my github account, along with the provided PDF
instructions, to one day look back on it, years later, when I'm far
more competent, in order to remember this horrible class. If you're
reading this in the future, Noah, take a stab at fixing your code or
maybe start anew. At the very least, have a chuckle at your attempt at
solving what (you believed at the time) to be a graduate-level
assignment.
