## Building:

Run `make` inside the project folder, this will compile it and produce
a binary called `project1`, which can be run. If `make` isn't
available, a typical `g++` invoke on the cpp files should work.

## Running:

I elected to go with the following syntax:

`./project1 in1.txt in2.txt`

Which should be used with the "non-v" format of matrix, like


```
0 0 0 0
1 0 1 0
1 0 0 0
0 0 1 0
```
