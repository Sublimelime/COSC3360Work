## Building:

Run `make` inside the project folder, this will compile it and produce
a binary called `project2`, which can be run. If `make` isn't
available, a typical `g++` invoke on the cpp files should work.

`make clean` will clean compilation artifacts and close semaphores/processes, if any remain.

## Running:

I elected to go with the following syntax:

`./project2 many.txt many_words.txt`

## Potential issues

Assumed no more than 9 processes and resources/resource types, for simplicity.
